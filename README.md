# Gene-445-Final
Python Script to Calculate and Visualize Gene Expression Changes in Samples. 


We transformed an existing R-script meant to analyze RNA-seqeuncing data from mouse models that were maintained in an exercised state and a non-exercised state, at two different time points (8am & 8pm). We then calculated log differences and geometric fold changes based on the TPM values inserted. Histograms were plotted to visualize results. Python packages utilized were numpy, matlabpyplot, and pandas.
